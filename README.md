# 👋 Welcome to XYZSensory Lab

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **XYZSensory Lab** at the Johns Hopkins University!

We are a group of loving and curious human beings who study sensory sciences. We strive for research applications for individuals with sensory impairment in real life.

## 🧠 About Us
Our lab conducts research that centers on population with low vision. Low vision refers to vision problems that cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. We call our lab “Sensory Lab” because vision works with other senses in our everyday life, and vision loss can be accompanied by other sensory loss.

The many projects in our lab can be categorized under two main themes, one aiming at Enhancing the Vision Accessibility of our environment, and one aiming at standardizing rehab care for Dual Sensory Impairment. While these two themes seem distinct from each other, they share concepts, methodologies, and principles, which characterize the key values and uniqueness of our lab.
